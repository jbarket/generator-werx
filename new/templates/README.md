# werx.Skeleton

## Skeleton PHP-MVC application implementing the components from the [Werx Project](http://werx.github.io).

Use this as a clean starting point in your Werx-based projects.

Briefly, the Werx Project bundles the following components and lets them work together to form the
basic building blocks of a PHP application:

- Configuration Management - [werx\Config](https://github.com/werx/config)
- Database Abstraction - [Illuminate\Database](https://github.com/illuminate/database)
- HTTP Abstraction - [Symfony\HttpFoundation](https://github.com/symfony/HttpFoundation)
- Routing - [Aura.Router](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Router)
- Templates - [Plates Native PHP Templates](http://platesphp.com/)
- Unit Tests - [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) (of course, why use anything else?)
